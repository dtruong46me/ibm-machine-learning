**5. Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning** (31 hours)

This course introduces you to two of the most sought-after disciplines in Machine Learning: Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that has applications in both Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, and is frequently used to power most of the AI applications that we use on a daily basis. First you will learn about the theory behind Neural Networks, which are the basis of Deep Learning, as well as several modern architectures of Deep Learning. Once you have developed a few  Deep Learning models, the course will focus on Reinforcement Learning, a type of Machine Learning that has caught up more attention recently. Although currently Reinforcement Learning has only a few practical applications, it is a promising area of research in AI that might become relevant in the near future.

After this course, if you have followed the courses of the IBM Specialization in order, you will have considerable practice and a solid understanding in the main types of Machine Learning which are: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.
