## Learning Goals
- Splitting data into training and test samples
- Cross-validation approaches
- Model complexity vs Error

### Use Training and Test Data
**Training Data**: Fit the model

**Test Data**: Measure performance:
- Predict label with model
- Compare with actual value
- Measure Error

### Fitting Training and Test Data

```sequence
Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Note right of Bob: Bob thinks
Bob-->Alice: I am good thanks!
